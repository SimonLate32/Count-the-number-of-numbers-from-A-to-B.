Calculate the number of numbers from A to B (integers) such that the digits of the number, considered in order from left to right, form an arithmetic or geometric progression. We assume that all single-digit and two-digit numbers form an arithmetic progression. To determine whether the number fits the requirements of the task, implement the function. Also implement a function for counting the number of such numbers from 1 to n. It is forbidden to use strings and arrays.
